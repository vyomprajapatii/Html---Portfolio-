  Student at Indus University since 2023, pursuing a BSc in Computer Science with a keen focus on AI/ML and web development.

  Fascinated by the world of technology, I'm dedicated to mastering the building blocks of coding, from Python and Java to understanding data structures and database management with MySQL. Passionate about harnessing these skills to create innovative solutions that simplify complexities and enhance user experiences. And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn.

  Outside of tech , I enjoy studying business stories to learn successful strategies and I have fascination for automobiles</p>
